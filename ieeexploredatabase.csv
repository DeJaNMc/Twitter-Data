The goals of this retrospective study are to identify dominant topics of Twitter-based research, summarize the temporal trend of topics, and interpret the evolution of topics withing the last ten years. This study systematically mines a large number of Twitter-based studies to characterize the relevant literature by an efficient and effective approach. This study collected relevant papers from three databases and applied text mining and trend analysis to detect semantic patterns and explore the yearly development of research themes across a decade. We found 38 topics in more than 18,000 manuscripts published between 2006 and 2019. By quantifying temporal trends, this study found that while 23.7% of topics did not show a significant trend (P = 0.05), 21% of topics had increasing trends and 55.3% of topics had decreasing trends that these hot and cold topics represent three categories: application, methodology, and technology.

In this paper, we propose a methodology, based on Twitter data, to capture the satisfaction of a large mass of users of public transport, allowing us to improve the characterization and location of their satisfaction level. We analyzed a massive volume of tweets referring to the public transport system in Santiago, Chile (Transantiago) using text mining techniques, such as sentiment analysis and topic modeling, in order to capture and group bus users' expressions. Results show that, although the level of detail and variety of answers obtained from surveys are higher than the ones obtained by our method, the amount of bus stops and bus services covered by the proposed scheme is larger. Moreover, the proposed methodology can be effectively used to diagnose problems in a timely manner, as it is able to identify and locate trends, and issues related to bus operating firms, whereas surveys tend to produce average answers. Based on the consistency and logic of the results, we argue that the proposed methodology can be used as a valuable complement to surveys, as both present different, but compatible characteristics.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2915107","Volvo Research and Educational Foundations; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8708245","Natural language processing;public transport;sentiment analysis;topic modeling;user satisfaction","Databases;Twitter;Sentiment analysis;Tools;Real-time systems;Analytical models;Software","data mining;human factors;public transport;sentiment analysis;social networking (online)","Santiago;Chile;public transport system;regular measurements;sound measurements;typical evaluation schemes;time-consuming surveys;Twitter data;satisfaction level;sentiment analysis;topic modeling;bus stops;bus services;timely manner;bus operating firms;user satisfaction;text mining techniques;group bus users expression","","10","","23","OAPA","7 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the unpredictability of the users and topics in social networks, predicting the topic propagation trend is still a major challenge. Different users play different roles in topic propagation. However, existing studies have not utilized user role analysis. In this paper, we propose a topic propagation prediction method (TPP) based on user role analysis and dynamic probability model.

Local newsworthy events, sports team victories or defeats, abnormal weather patterns and globally trending topics all influence the content of online discussion. The automated discovery of these underlying themes from corpora of text is of interest to numerous academic fields as well as to law enforcement organizations and commercial users. One useful class of tools to deal with such problems are topic models, which attempt to recover latent groups of word associations from the text. However, it is clear that these topics may also exhibit patterns in both time and space. The recovery of such patterns complements the analysis of the text itself and in many cases provides additional context. In this work we describe two methods for mining interesting spatio-temporal dynamics and relations among topics, one that compares the topic distributions as histograms in space and time and another that models topics over time as temporal or spatio-temporal Hawkes process with exponential trigger functions. Both methods may be used to discover topics with abnormal distributions in space and time. The second method also allows for self-exciting topics and can recover intertopic relationships (excitation or inhibition) in both time and space. We apply these methods to a geo-tagged Twitter dataset and provide analysis and discussion of the results.","1464-3634","","10.1093/imamat/hxw025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8132644","mining complex datasets;spatial and temporal analysis;topic modeling;cluster analysis","","","","","3","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Therefore, interpersonal relationships have also been following this trend so that social networks have become increasingly present in our lives. Given this context, social network users create and share a large amount of data, from content about their daily lives, funny facts, as well as information about traffic, weather, and various subjects. The problem of event detection in social media, such as Twitter, is related to the identification of the first story on a topic of interest. In this work, we propose a novel approach based on the observation that tweets are subjected to a continuous phase transition when an event takes place, i.e., its underlying dynamic changes. Our proposal consists of a formal characterization of the phase transition that occurs when an event takes place, and the use of this characterization to devise a new method to detect events in Twitter, based on calculating the entropy of the keywords extracted from the content of tweets (regardless of the language used). We evaluated the performance of our approach using seven data sets, and we outperformed nine different techniques present in the literature. Unlike the work found in the literature, we present a theoretical rationale about the existence of phase transitions. For this, we characterize a model, already existing in the literature, of phase transitions described by differential equations, where we find correspondence between the model used in the study and the real data.

In this paper, a novel method that considers the behaviors and characteristics of users is proposed to identify and predict suspected bursty hot events. First, the keywords in each tweet are extracted and divided into different sets according to part of speech, and then similar topics are clustered according to semantic similarity. Second, the growth rates of topics are monitored in the sliding timestamp and the suspected bursty hot events are marked. Then, a user relationship network is constructed based on the information of the registered users on Twitter. Finally, according to the propagation trend of suspected bursty hot events in the network, the quasi-burst hot events are marked and sorted in descending order. Experimental results show that only using the historical re-tweeting behavior of users as the judgment basis to predict the current re-tweeting probability of users will lead to the phenomenon of error cascading, while taking the information of users into account can effectively improve the prediction performance. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed method improves the prediction precision rate by 27.38%, accuracy rate by 23.49%, and recall rate by 20.16%, demonstrating that it can predict bursty hot events effectively.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2977424","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2017YFB1400602,2016YFB0800401); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61572371,61702377); Technology Innovation Special Program of Hubei Province(grant numbers:2018ACA13); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9019688","Hot event prediction;suspected bursty hot events;semantic similarity;user relationship network","Semantics;Twitter;Monitoring;OWL;Predictive models;Ontologies","probability;social networking (online)","user relationship network;hot event prediction;online social networks;user information;poor prediction effect;suspected bursty hot events;registered users;prediction performance;prediction precision rate;bursty hot events;Twitter","","2","","27","CCBY","2 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The online connectivity of devices through social media is one example of Internet of Things (IoT) in which a two-way communication between societies and officials, could be created. Therefore, it is possible to monitor people’s behavior through OSNs, especially during pandemics, to prevent potential social and psychological instabilities that might lead to undesired consequences. This is particularly crucial for governmental and non-governmental organizations to ensure the stability and well-being in societies. In response, we propose a pandemic-friendly real-time framework for monitoring cyber social behavior by utilizing unsupervised and supervised learning approaches. Two BERT-based supervised classifiers are trained and constructed to analyze two types of online social behaviors, hate and sentiment. Unsupervised framework is proposed for OSNs data exploration and coherent interpretation that is used as a complementary tool to facilitate the analysis of online social behaviors during pandemics. Extensive experimentation and evaluation have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed work. Our results have shown superior performance of our BERT-based models in two classification tasks: 1) binary classification for hate behavior detection and 2) multi-class classification for sentiment behavior detection. In addition to our experimentation results, our large-scale analysis of COVID-19 pandemic has illustrated the capability of our unsupervised framework for concerns and trends discoveries using OSNs data, along with reliability in automatically and dynamically providing phrase-based interpenetration of the inferred trends and concerns.

Social Behavioral Biometric (SBB), being an emerging trend, focuses on such trails to distinguish between individuals. This research investigates the impact of users’ writing profiles on OSN to conclude whether such profiles contribute to SBB. The distinctiveness of the SBB features that are extracted from the social behavioral data of Twitter is studied. A person identification system that relies on users’ writing profiles, reply, retweet, shared weblink, trendy topic networks and temporal profiles is proposed. Score and rank level weighted fusion algorithm performance is compared on a social interaction database of 241 Twitter users. The experimental results establish that the users’ writing profiles have the highest impact over other social biometric features and that score level fusion algorithms perform better than rank level fusion on SBB.

The users' interactions with these social sites, such as Twitter and Facebook have a tremendous impact and occasionally undesirable repercussions for daily life. The prominent social networking sites have turned into a target platform for the spammers to disperse a huge amount of irrelevant and deleterious information. Twitter, for example, has become one of the most extravagantly used platforms of all times and therefore allows an unreasonable amount of spam. Fake users send undesired tweets to users to promote services or websites that not only affect legitimate users but also disrupt resource consumption. Moreover, the possibility of expanding invalid information to users through fake identities has increased that results in the unrolling of harmful content. Recently, the detection of spammers and identification of fake users on Twitter has become a common area of research in contemporary online social Networks (OSNs). In this paper, we perform a review of techniques used for detecting spammers on Twitter. Moreover, a taxonomy of the Twitter spam detection approaches is presented that classifies the techniques based on their ability to detect: (i) fake content, (ii) spam based on URL, (iii) spam in trending topics, and (iv) fake users. The presented techniques are also compared based on various features, such as user features, content features, graph features, structure features, and time features.

Consequently, it is a crucial platform for maximizing community influence which has broad application prospects in recommendation system, advertising and other fields. With the rapid development of the mobile Internet, online social networks are gradually infiltrating into our daily lives, in which the communities are an important part of social networks. The combination of social networking and edge computing technology has important application value and is the development trend of influence maximization in future networks. However, traditional influence maximization models look for the most influential seed nodes while ignoring the fact that the selected seed nodes are various for different event topics, which significantly reduces the efficiency and accuracy of event propagation. In addition, most existing methods focus only on event propagation and neglect multiple topics in event propagation. At the same time, the interests of users in the network are not always single and the user's interest and the topic of the event will change over time, thus making it challenging to track momentous events in a timely manner. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Multi-Topic Learning-based Independent Cascade model (MTL-IC), and a Similarity Priority Mechanism-based Event Evolution model (SPM-EE). MTL-IC incorporates multi-topic factors and considers the authority and hub in interests of user, which makes the results more efficient and more accurate. SPM-EE can update the seed users according to their changeable interest in time, which largely improve the precision of event evolution. The experimental results, using Twitter datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods for both dynamic community influence maximization and event evolution.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3022096","National Natural Science of Foundation of China Program(grant numbers:61502209,61502207); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9187341","Dynamic community influence maximization;microblogging;IC;event evolution","Twitter;Internet;Data mining;Approximation algorithms;Edge computing;Market research","Internet;social networking (online)","MTL-IC;multitopic factors;seed users;dynamic community influence maximization;social media data streams;microblogging;information channel;online social networks;social networking;edge computing technology;influential seed nodes;event topics;event propagation;momentous events;multitopic learning-based independent cascade model;influence maximization models;similarity priority mechanism-based event evolution model;social media service platform","","3","","49","CCBY","7 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It shows that people’s interests are organized in clusters around different topics, but the rising of an extraordinary emergency event, as the coronavirus disease epidemics, channels the people’s attention into a more homogenized structure, shifting it as triggered by a non-random collective process. The connectedness of networked individuals, on multiple social levels, impacts on the attention, representing a tuning element of different behavioural outcomes, changing the awareness diffusion enough to produce effects on epidemics spreading. We propose a mathematical framework to model the interplay between the collective attention and the co-evolving processes of awareness diffusion, modelled as a social contagion phenomenon, and epidemic spreading on weighted multiplex networks. Our proposed modeling approach structures a systematically understanding as a social network marker of interdependent collective dynamics through the introduction of the multiplex dimension of both networked individuals and topics, quantifying the role of human-related factors, as homophily, network properties, and heterogeneity. We introduce a data-driven approach by integrating different types of data, digitally traced as user-generated data from Twitter and Google Trends, in response to an extraordinary emergency event as coronavirus disease. Our findings demonstrate how the proposed model allows us to quantify the reaction of the collective attention, proving that it can represent a social predictive marker of the awareness dynamics, unveiling the impact on epidemic spreading, for a timely crisis response planning.

Geotagged tweets are used for volume analysis indicating that the highest number of tweets is originated from India, the US, the UK, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. Analysis of positive and negative tweets reveals that negative tweets are mostly originated from India and the US. On the contrary, positive tweets belong to Pakistan and Afghanistan. LDA is used for topic modeling on two datasets containing tweets about the current situation after the Taliban take control of Afghanistan. Topics extracted through LDA suggest that majority of the Afghanistan people seem satisfied with the Taliban’s takeover while the topics from negative tweets reveal that issues discussed in negative tweets are related to the US concerns in Afghanistan. Sentiment analysis over two different datasets indicates that the trend of the sentiments has been shifted positively over three weeks.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3144659","Florida Center for Advanced Analytics and Data Science funded by Ernesto.Net (under the Algorithms for Good Grant); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9686742","Topic modeling;sentiment analysis;Taliban regime;latent Dirichlet allocation;machine learning","Sentiment analysis;Social networking (online);Analytical models;Feature extraction;Blogs;Machine learning;Support vector machines","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);sentiment analysis;social networking (online);social sciences computing","volume analysis;sentiment analysis;text mining;geotagged tweets;Afghanistan;LDA;latent Dirichlet allocation;microblogging websites;social media platforms;machine learning models","","1","","40","CCBY","19 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
